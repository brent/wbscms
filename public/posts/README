Posts get thier date from the folders they're in.

If you have an article called hello_world.md and it was written on Feb. 12th, 2015 you would add it to the following path (creating directories when necessary):

/posts/2015/02/12/hello_world.md

The leading zero in months is important--don't forget it.
